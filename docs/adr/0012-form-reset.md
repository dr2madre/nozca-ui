# 12. Form reset restores the current default, silently

Date: 2026-09-09

## Status

Accepted, and binding for every adapter, present and future. Being binding is
not being implemented: the table says where it holds today.

| Adapter | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Svelte | Implemented. |
| Vue | Implemented. |
| React | **Required, not implemented.** Its form controls do not reset yet. |
| Elements | **Required, not implemented.** Same. |
| Any future adapter | Required before its form controls are called equivalent. |

A package that has not implemented it must not be described as having form
parity, and a control that submits a value is not finished until it resets.
The requirement is carried in `docs/adapters-roadmap.md` (React),
`docs/next-adapter-strategy.md` (Elements) and `docs/component-backlog.md`
(adapter parity), so that a port cannot reach "done" without it.

## Context

`form.reset()`, a reset button, and every native reset path restored nothing
in any adapter except NumberField: values written as DOM properties leave no
default behind them, and composite controls keep their payload in hidden
inputs the reset algorithm cannot touch. The investigation, the reference
behaviour and the options are in `docs/form-reset-contract.md`; the decision
was taken there and is recorded here.

## Decision

A form reset restores each control to its **current default** and reports
nothing.

- The current default is the last value the consumer passed through the
  public `value` prop, reflected into the DOM default. Never the user's edit,
  never a snapshot taken at mount. One rule keeps that true under the
  adapters' two-way idiom: a prop change that only gives back what the control
  itself reported does not move the default, the same give-back test the state
  conventions already apply to callbacks. Without it, `bind:value` would drag
  the default along with every keystroke and a reset would restore the edit it
  was meant to undo. A controlled parent that holds its own copy still goes
  stale on reset; its own `reset` handler on the form is where its state comes
  back.
- No change callback fires, and no per-control reset callback exists. The
  standard says reset changes are not user changes; ADR 0011 says only a user
  action reports. The form's own bubbling, cancelable `reset` event is the one
  notification, and it already belongs to the consumer.
- The event arrives before the browser restores anything. A consumer restores
  their own state in the handler; they read the form's restored values only in
  a later task; `preventDefault()` replaces the native restore, and the
  components' restore honours it too.
- Two layers implement it. The DOM carries real defaults (`value` and
  `checked` attributes, option `selected`, textarea content) so the browser's
  own algorithm works and server-rendered markup is correct with no script.
  And each control that keeps state of its own listens for its owner's `reset`
  through one shared helper (`core`'s `formReset.onFormReset`) and puts that
  state back with the same no-notify writes the state conventions already use.
  A control that keeps none, like the standalone Radio, needs no listener: its
  element is its whole state, and the `checked` attribute is the restore.
- The restore puts the control's own copy of the value back too. A consumer
  using `bind:value` therefore ends the reset agreeing with the page; a
  consumer holding a separate copy still has to put that copy back, and the
  form's `reset` event is where.

## Consequences

Uncontrolled consumers get working resets with no code. Controlled consumers
add one `reset` handler per form. A control whose state was not put back would
show the restored value and hold the old one, so tests hold payload, visible
state and callback silence together.

Two limits are deliberate. A parent that answers an edit by setting the prop
to the very value the user typed is indistinguishable from an echo, so that
value does not become the new default; a parent that means it can say so with
a different value first, or reset its own state instead. And a form reset in a
detached subtree restores the DOM but reaches no listener, so the control's
state waits for the next prop sync; a native-only consumer sees the same
asymmetry.
