# Contributing

The working conventions for every change in **Invisible UI** (by
nozcadesign), a headless, accessible, multi-framework component library.

> **Note:** The project is in alpha and code changes stay with the
> maintainer while names and structure settle. The way to help today is
> **reporting**: open an issue for anything that looks wrong or missing.
> These guidelines record the conventions every change follows, and they
> become the contributor guide when the project opens up.

## Ground rules

This library has three pillars. Every contribution upholds them:

- **Accessibility**: follow the relevant
  [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) pattern.
  Correct roles and attributes, full keyboard support and proper focus
  management are required. Any styled output (examples and the theme layer)
  must meet **WCAG AA** contrast: **4.5:1** for normal text and **3:1** for
  large text.
- **Responsiveness**: components are **responsive by default**. They work
  across viewport sizes and input modalities (pointer, touch, keyboard) and
  never assume a fixed width or a single input type.
- **Headless**: the core ships behavior and semantics only. Opinionated
  visual styling stays out of the primitives; the recommended (overridable)
  visual defaults live in [`docs/foundations.md`](./docs/foundations.md).
- **Security**: components are **safe with untrusted data**. Consumer values
  are treated as data, never as markup or code, and the dependencies stay
  free of known vulnerabilities.

## Running the checks locally

Rebuild after every `git pull`, before running any test:

```sh
pnpm install && pnpm exec turbo run build
```

`dist/` is gitignored, so pulling new code leaves the built packages as they
were. The adapters' tests import the built core, so they fail on code that is
correct, and the failures point at whatever changed last. CI never shows this:
its gate builds first. Treat a red suite straight after a sync as a stale build
until proven otherwise.

## Branching and merging

1. Create a branch off `main` with a short kebab-case name that describes
   the change, prefixed by its type: `feature/combobox`, `fix/link-tests`,
   `docs/why-page`, `chore/trim-gitignore`. Every name in this repository
   (branches, files, examples) describes its content; generated or
   placeholder names are rejected in review.
2. Keep changes focused; one logical change per pull request.
3. Open a pull request against `main`. Pull requests are **squash-merged**.
4. After the merge: update local `main` (`git fetch` + fast-forward) and
   delete the branch.

## Commit conventions

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format;
commitlint enforces it (header up to 100 characters, lowercase subject, body
lines up to 100 characters):

```
type(scope): short summary

feat(react): add headless Combobox primitive
fix(core): correct roving tabindex in Menu
docs: document Dialog usage
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.

Commit messages and pull request descriptions describe the change and
nothing else: remove any footer, signature or link that a tool appends, in
the message and in the pull request body, before the merge.

## Authorship & human oversight

Every contribution requires **human review and oversight** before it is
pushed. Commits must be authored by a **human account**. Configure your git
author name and email to match your own (or your GitHub) identity before
contributing; commits from the maintainer are authored as `dr2madre
(48051639+dr2madre@users.noreply.github.com)`.

Signing commits is encouraged: the signature proves where a commit comes
from. The responsibility behind it is always a person's.

AI assistants may help draft changes, but they must **never** appear as the
author of a commit, neither as the sole author nor as a co-author. No
`Co-Authored-By` trailers for AI tools, and no automated or placeholder
author identities. An AI cannot accept responsibility for code, so it cannot
be credited as an author.

**Only the human who uses the AI is responsible for what gets pushed.** That
person must review, understand, and stand behind every change submitted
under their name.

## Writing

All prose (documentation, site copy, UI messages) follows
[`docs/copy-guidelines.md`](./docs/copy-guidelines.md): direct, simple,
active voice, positive statements, no em dashes, no metaphors, no promises
about the future. Translation and terminology notes live in
[`docs/translation-notes.md`](./docs/translation-notes.md).

## Code comments

A comment records what the code cannot express: a constraint, a platform
quirk, the reason behind a non-obvious choice. The code shows _what_
happens; the comment answers _why_.

- Write plainly: short sentences, common words, readable at every level of
  experience. One or two lines is the norm; component docblocks may run
  longer when the API needs it.
- State each fact once, where readers look for it. API rules live in the
  component docblock; a test or fixture references them with a short note
  at most.
- Prop docs are one short sentence naming the value. Constraints the type
  already expresses (required, allowed values) stay out of the text.
- Comments describe the code as it stands. Notes that narrate the next
  line or argue that a change is correct belong in the pull request;
  history belongs to git.

## Token naming (headless)

Tokens are **headless**: a token name expresses _role_ or _state_, never
visual style.

- Allowed, role/state names: `primary`, `danger`, `surface`,
  `text-secondary`, `disabled`, `state-hover`, `focus-ring`, `on-emphasis`,
  `elevation-2`, `radius-control`.
- Forbidden, style adjectives that describe appearance: `muted`, `soft`,
  `subtle`, `raised`. (A word like `mute` is fine only when it names a
  genuine _state_, e.g. a muted microphone.)
- Primitives hold the raw palette and scales; semantic tokens map them to
  roles and states.

See [`docs/foundations.md`](./docs/foundations.md) for the full naming rules.

## Proposing a new component

When proposing a new headless component, please include:

1. **The pattern**: which WAI-ARIA pattern it implements, with a link.
2. **Behavior spec**: interaction model, keyboard map, focus behavior, and
   the states it manages.
3. **Accessibility notes**: roles, ARIA attributes, and screen-reader
   expectations.
4. **Framework parity**: how the primitive maps across the supported
   frameworks. Shared behavior lives in `core/`, with thin
   framework-specific adapters; behavior stays consistent everywhere.
5. **Examples**: minimal usage demonstrating the unstyled primitive.

## Decisions

Significant choices are recorded in [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/). Read the
existing records before changing an established pattern, and add a record
when a decision is worth remembering.

## Review process

- At least one maintainer review is required before merge.
- Reviews check the three pillars (accessibility, responsiveness, headless),
  cross-framework consistency, naming, and code clarity.
- Address review feedback by pushing follow-up commits to the same branch.
